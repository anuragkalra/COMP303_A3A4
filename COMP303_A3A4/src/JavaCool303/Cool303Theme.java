 * JavaCool303 is based on themes. A developer wanting to use your JavaCool303 package
 * must provide a Cool303Theme class that modifies the look of the GUI. But, your package
 * will come built in with two themes: Pastel and Winter. Pastel must use pastel colours
 * with bubble-like shapes (as best as you can do) for buttons / boxes / windows; Winter I
 * will leave it to your imagination.
